### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Microbiologist at [Environment and Climate Change Canada](https://ec.gc.ca/).

My background is in environmental microbiology. Feel free to parse my thesis ["Assessing toluene biodegradation potential in groundwater using molecular biological tools."](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/27429)

When I'm not busy, I like dabbling in computer science and data visulization.
